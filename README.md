This is a practice "ecosystem" for issuing a loan based on a deposited collateral and using the borrowed funds for further trading, including basic flashloan functionality.

Note that there are many backdoors and not yet resolved loopholes that allow anybody to drain nearly any balance of the bank / exchange / token holder. These may or may not be fixed in the future. 

The goal is not to build a functional production ready protocol for use with real world money. The goal is to practice and test some mechanisms that I've learned over the past few days.
